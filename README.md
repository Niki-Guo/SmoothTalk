"Tell me about yourself."
"Uhmmm, my name is Niki and I uh, study at BCIT... Uhhh..." 

Does this sound like you? 

Well, the next time you're practicing for a presentation or interview, try using SmoothTalk! 
SmoothTalk helps you visualize your "um", "ah", "uh"s (aka filler words) and accesses whether your speech is clear and concise! 

Whether you're a student preparing for a presentation, going in for a job interview, or just want to improve public speaking. 
SmoothTalk is here to help. 

Our main functionalities are: 
1. Speech to text service shows you how clearly and accurately you are pronouncing your words! 
2. The transcript highlights the filler words used and generates a total filler word count in real-time, visualizing it for you! 
3. We provide a rating on your perf'um'ance, which is calculated based on your “ums” per session. 
(under 5% is excellent, 5-10% is great, 10%-20% is good, 20%+ needs improvement!) 
We hope to implement more user statistics and tracking in the future!
